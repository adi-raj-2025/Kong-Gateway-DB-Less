## üìÅ Folder / File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml     # Main Docker Compose configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kong.yml               # Declarative Kong configuration (Routes, Services, Plugins, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prometheus.yml         # Prometheus configuration for monitoring
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Verify installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

---

### 2. Start the Kong Gateway Stack

To start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will:
- Launch **Kong Gateway**
- Load declarative configuration from `kong.yml`
- Start **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for metrics monitoring
Once started, verify that the containers are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

### 3. Accessing Kong

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Kong Admin API** | `http://localhost:8001` | Manage and inspect Kong configuration |
| **Kong Proxy (Public)** | `http://localhost:8000` | Route external API traffic |
| **Kong Manager** | `http://localhost:8002` | Web UI for managing Kong |
| **Prometheus** | `http://localhost:9090` | View collected metrics |
| **Grafana** | `http://localhost:9000` | View collected metrics |

---

### 4. Stop and Remove Containers

To gracefully stop all containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want to remove all volumes and networks created by this stack:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

---

### 5. View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
